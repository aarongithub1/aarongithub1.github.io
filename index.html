          <p>Write at least 5 blog posts on topics from the following list as you encounter them while working through ‘Java the Hard Way’:
• What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?
• When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.
• To generate a random number you use ‘Math.random()’. What is ‘Math’? What is the return type of the ‘.random()’ method. Why is the ‘M’ in ‘Math’ capitalized (you may need to investigate Static classes...hint hint).
• What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.
• What is the difference between a ‘for’, ‘while’ and ‘do while’ loop? Give an example of when you would use one versus another. What is the benefit of a ‘do while’ over a ‘while’?
• What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?
• What is ‘void’ in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?
• When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?|||||Write at least 5 blog posts on topics from the following list as you encounter them while working through ‘Java the Hard Way’:
