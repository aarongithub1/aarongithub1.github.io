          <p><strong>When would you use ‘=’ vs ‘==’ vs ‘.equals’? Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</strong><br /><br />

In Java, the ‘=‘ is used to direct data to be stored into a variable. The data to the right of the ‘=‘ will be stored into the variable to the left of the ‘=‘.<br /><br />

Some examples of how this works:<br /><br />

int Num = 0;<br />
(int Num is “defined”, variable was created and assigned the value of 0 at the same time.)<br />
————————————-<br />
int Num;<br />
Num = 5;<br />
(Num will store the value of 5)<br />
————————————-<br />
int Num;<br />
Num = 5*5;<br />
(Num will store the value of 25)<br />
————————————-<br />
int Num1, Num2, Num3;<br />
Num1 = 10;<br />
Num2 = 20;<br />
Num3 = Num1+Num2;<br />
(Num3 will store the value of 30, it will not store the formula - "Num1+Num2")<br /><br />

The ‘==‘ is one of six Boolean operators for comparing items.<br /><br />

> (greater than)<br />
>= (greater than or equal to)<br />
< (less than)<br />
<= (less than or equal to)<br />
== (equal to)<br />
!= (not equal to)<br /><br />

If the items being compared elavuate to a "true" statement then the value "true" will be stored into the variable.<br /><br />

For example:<br /><br />

int x = 5, y = 10;<br />
boolean a, b, c;<br /><br />

a = (x < y);<br />
b = (x == y);<br />
c = (x != y);<br /><br />

The first statement will result in a "true" being stored into 'a', because x is less than y.<br />
The second statement will result in a "false" being stored into 'b'<br />, because x is not equal to y.<br />
And the third statement will result in a "true" being stored into 'c', because x is not equal to y.<br /><br />

Finally, if you are trying to compare two 'strings' rather than 'integers/doubles' you will need to use the built-in method '.equals()'<br /><br />

For example:<br /><br />

String word = "hello";<br />
boolean yes, no;<br /><br />

yes = word.equals("hello");<br />
(This is true)<br /><br />
no = ! word.equals("hello");<br />
(This is false)<br /><br />
yes = ! word.equals("testing");<br />
(This is true)<br /><br />
no = word.equals("testing");<br />
(This is false)<br /><br />

          <p><strong>What is "void" in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</strong><br /><br />
            A "void" in a method declaration indicates that the method will not return a value. If you want to return a value
                from a method the "return type" must be indicated in the method declaration. <br /><br />For example:<br /><br />public static void testMethod(int testInt) {<br /><br />}<br /><br />
                    The example above will accept one integer, received from the Method Call, and declares a local variable called "testInt". After running any code between the curly braces, it will return nothing.<br /><br />
                        public static double randomMethod(int x, int y) {<br />
                            double tempDouble;<br /><br />
                            tempDouble = x / y;<br /><br />
                            return tempDouble;<br />
                        }<br /><br /> or simply:<br /><br />
                        public static double randomMethod(int x, int y) {<br /><br />

                            return x / y;<br />
                        }<br /><br />
                        In these examples, "randomMethod" will accept two integers and declare int x and y as local variables.<br />After it has completed it's task,
                            it will return a "double" value.<br /><br />
                                <strong>Note: (You may have learned this as a Function, but in Java, they have Methods rather than Functions.)</strong></p>

          <p><strong>What happens when you include ‘import java.util.Scanner;’ in your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the ‘java’ in ‘java.util.Scanner;’?</strong><br/><br/>
              The line of code “import java.util.Scanner;” is used to create a Scanner object for accepting user input from the Standard input (System.in). This functionality comes from the Scanner class within the java.util.* package.<br/><br/>
                Java has a very large class library (a grouping of packages) called the Java API, the acronym for “Application Programming Interface.” The "java" in "java.util.Scanner;" can be thought of as a file folder, or a way to organize related classes within the Java API, where "java" is the main folder containing all the classes and functionality a developer might need.<br/><br/>
                    <strong>Note: (There are other classes within the “java.util.*” package besides the Scanner class.)</strong><br/><br/></p>

          <p><strong>When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</strong><br /><br />

              In a gernerized conversation about parameters and arguments, these terms seem somewhat interchangeable, in that no one will start
              to get on your case if you swap these terms.<br /><br />
              That being said, there is a difference between these two terms, because they discribe the same data before and after the handoff.<br /><br />

              When you want to call on a method you must write a Method Call, also known as a Function Call.<br/><br/>
              The following is a method call to the method "threeParameters"<br/>
              This will pass three <strong>arguments (7, 8, 9)</strong>, to the method named "threeParameters".<br/>
              From there "threeParameters" will accept the arguments and will 'define' three integers (int a, int b, int c)<br/><br />
              <strong>(int a, int b, int c)</strong> are the <strong>parameters</strong>. After running the code within the curly braces, it will return a double value to be stored in the variable "getDouble"<br/><br/><br/>

              getDouble = threeParameters(7, 8, 9);  << arguments<br/><br/>

              public static double threeParameters(int a, int b, int c) {  << parameters<br/>
                  double tempDouble;<br/><br/>
                  tempDouble = (a*b)/c;<br/><br/>
                  return tempDouble<br/>
                  }</p>

          <p><strong>What does it mean to ‘cast a double to an int’? Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.</strong><br /><br />
              When we have seen casting, it has been used with the built-in Math.random() method. It does not require the Math.random() method to perform 'casting.'<br /><br />
                Basicly what casting is doing, is taking a fractional number and shaving off everything to the right of the decimal. (turning it into a whole number)<br /><br />

                So, in the example:<br /><br />

                i = (int)(9.98765);<br />
                System.out.println("i = "+i);<br />
                <strong>output will be: 9</strong><br /><br />

                This is because 9.98765 will have everything to the right of the decimal removed, and will only accept the whole number 9 when it is cast into an integer.<br /></p>
